# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
npm create svelte@latest

npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building
```bash
npm run build
```
You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
